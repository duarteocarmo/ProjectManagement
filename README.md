# ProjectManagement

#### Introduction:

Project Management concerns the optimization and orientation of efforts towards effi-ciency in a complex task. This task is usually done over a period of time, and with ateam of people. However, applying OR methods and heuristics to deal with this issuecan be described as somewhat limited: generally non-dynamic, no sensibility etc.

Yet, the main focus of this project is; effort management, timeframe reduction, and costreduction. Therefore, it can be interesting to study exactly what scheduling method-ologies can be used to help achieve these goals. In this study, we will use as examplea fictional start-up to answer the following research question: “What Scheduling tech-niques can be directly applied to a simple start-up project and how can these techniqueshelp in minimizing the timeframe, cost, and unnecessary management effort?”

With the purpose of answering this question, 3 different scheduling techniques will be applied to a particular case and their validity/usefulness/flexibility will be discussed.
